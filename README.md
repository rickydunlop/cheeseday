# Cheeseday

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/rickydunlop/cheeseday.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A Facebook Messenger bot that sends bad cheese jokes every Tuesday


## Setup

Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`

Fill in the values for your setup.

You should have a MySQL database created using the sql in `cheeseday.sql`

### Install dependencies

Use npm or yarn to install the dependencies (Yarn is much faster)

## Deploying

The bot runs on AWS Lambda so the best solution for this is currently [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless).
